malloc-lab
==========

This lab was an assignment for the course 15-213 (Introduction to Computer Systems) at CMU. The goal was to create your very own implementation of the `malloc` function in C.
My implementation used an explicit free list based on storing the offset from the heap's lowest address within the free block. In addition, optimizations such as block splitting and immediate coalescing were also added.

In sight of the academic integrity policy at CMU, I have not posted the source code for my implementation, but have instead created this placeholder. If you are a potential employer or have any other valid reason to see the implementation, please contact me personally and I will gladly provide it!
